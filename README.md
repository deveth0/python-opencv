# OpenCV Python Examples

This repository contains severals examples on the usage of OpenCV in Python to do cool things.

## Projects

* Object Detection using YOLO: Detect Cats, Dogs, Birds and Stuff using a pretrained Model [README.md](objectDetection/README.md)
* Character Classification: Train and classify characters [README.md](characterClassification/README.md)


## Requirements

The differents projects have been tested using Python 3.7. You'll most likely need to install some additional software, depending on your system (e.g. using pip3):

```
pip3 install opencv-python numpy
```
